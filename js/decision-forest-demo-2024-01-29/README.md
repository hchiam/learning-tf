# My 2024-01-29 WORKING demo of running a TensorFlow decision forest model with TensorFlow.js

https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tf_df_in_tf_js

1. I ran this code to get `tfjs_model.zip`: [2024-01-29_tf.keras_works.ipynb](https://github.com/hchiam/learning-tf/blob/main/js/decision-forest-demo-2024-01-29/2024-01-29_tf.keras_works.ipynb) (I unzipped the `.zip` file to get `/tfjs_model/model.json` and `/tfjs_model/group1-shard1of1.bin` but **_ALSO IMPORTANTLY_** `/tfjs_model/assets.zip`)
2. Open this file in a browser to try it out:
   - `bun js/decision-forest-demo/index.tsx` or `npm run start` (you need to install `bun` first)
   - http://localhost:3000/
   - (see the console log output)
