# My demo of running a TensorFlow decision forest model with TensorFlow.js

https://www.tensorflow.org/decision_forests/tf_df_in_tf_js

1. I ran this code to get `tfjs_model.zip`: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1UYDQfaINlDHrT_ng3OkQ6ck_iq4MYASX?usp=sharing (unzip the `.zip` file and get the `model.json`)
2. Open this file in a browser to try it out: https://github.com/hchiam/learning-tf/blob/main/js/decision-forest-demo/index.html
   - `bun js/decision-forest-demo/index.html`
   - http://localhost:3000/
   - (see the console log output)
