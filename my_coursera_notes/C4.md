- **univariate** time series = one variable over time
- **multivariate** time series = multiple variables over time, but together are more helpful

- **real-word signals** you'll encounter will likely have a combination of:

  1. **trend** (global pattern, btw which can extend forward/backwards in time),
  2. **seasonality** (local pattern),
  3. **auto-correlation** (correlation with a delayed copy of itself),
  4. **noise** ("truly" unpredictable), and
  5. **non-stationary behaviour** (behaviour may change, so you might want to give your model only a "window" of the data)

- **fixed partitioning**:

  - consider splitting time series data into training/validation/test periods with whole numbers of seasonality "seasons" in each period.
  - Use training data vs validation data, then combine (training + validation) data vs test data. Why? test data = typically closest to current data, or is just future data

- **roll-forward partitioning**:

  - repeated fixed-partitioning with increasing size of training period to forecast next day in the validation period (i.e. in the validation data)

- metrics for evaluating sequence/time-series model perf:

  - `errors = forecasts - actual`
  - `mse = np.square(errors).mean()` = Mean Squared Error, squared to get rid of negative values and avoid positive/negative errors cancelling each other out.
  - `rmse = np.sqrt(mse)` = Root Mean Squared Error, for same scale of original errors.
  - `mae = np.abs(errors).mean()` = Mean Absolute Error (aka MAD for Mean Absolute Deviation), if you want to avoid penalizing large errors as much as MSE does.
    - `keras.metrics.mean_absolute_error(x_valid, naive_forecast).numpy()`
  - `mape = np.abs(errors / x_valid).mean()` = Mean Absolute Percentage Error, to give an idea of the size of the errors compared to the size of the values.

- **trailing window** = ??? - when use???
- **centered window** = ??? - when use???
