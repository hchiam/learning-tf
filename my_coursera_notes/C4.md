- univariate time series = one variable over time
- multivariate time series = multiple variables over time, but together are more helpful

- MAE = Mean Absolute Error = ??? to evaluate accuracy of sequence models - how???

- trailing window = ??? - when use???
- centered window = ??? - when use???
