- **univariate** time series = one variable over time
- **multivariate** time series = multiple variables over time, but together are more helpful

- **real-word signals** you'll encounter will likely have a combination of:

  1. **trend** (global pattern, btw which can extend forward/backwards in time),
  2. **seasonality** (local pattern),
  3. **auto-correlation** (correlation with a delayed copy of itself),
  4. **noise** ("truly" unpredictable), and
  5. **non-stationary behaviour** (behaviour may change, so you might want to give your model only a "window" of the data)

- **fixed partitioning**:

  - consider splitting time series data into training/validation/test periods with whole numbers of seasonality "seasons" in each period.
  - Use training data vs validation data, then combine (training + validation) data vs test data. Why? test data = typically closest to current data, or is just future data

- **roll-forward partitioning**:

  - repeated fixed-partitioning with increasing size of training period to forecast next day in the validation period (i.e. in the validation data)

- MAE = Mean Absolute Error = ??? to evaluate accuracy of sequence models - how???

- **trailing window** = ??? - when use???
- **centered window** = ??? - when use???
