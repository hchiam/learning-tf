- univariate time series = one variable over time
- multivariate time series = multiple variables over time, but together are more helpful

- real-word signals you'll encounter will likely have a combination of:

  1. trend (global pattern, btw which can extend forward/backwards in time),
  2. seasonality (local pattern),
  3. auto-correlation (correlation with a delayed copy of itself),
  4. noise ("truly" unpredictable), and
  5. non-stationary behaviour (behaviour may change, so you might want to give your model only a "window" of the data)

- MAE = Mean Absolute Error = ??? to evaluate accuracy of sequence models - how???

- trailing window = ??? - when use???
- centered window = ??? - when use???
